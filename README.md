### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

I prioritized the feature set of the app because I wanted to show how a simple set of data could be used and maniuplated in different ways including grouping and filtering.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

The basic functionality was completed within 3 hours, but then I spent an additional 3 hours determining the final feature set and making adjustments to the new features.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

I'm not a great designer, though I did marry one, so there are definite trade-offs in terms of overal visual design.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

There is some shared code in the list views that I could abstract out into separate views to keep things cleaner.

While the overall business logic has solid code coverage it would have been nice to add UI tests to add coverage for all the view models. There also might be some logic in the views that should be moved elsewhere.
